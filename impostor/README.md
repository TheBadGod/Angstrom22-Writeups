# Impostor

Just run the program dummy.

(I have no idea what the program does, all I know is that a teammate told me to
patch it together so it doesn't crash, so I removed size doubling and made the
inital size big enough and everything worked perfecly)

The solver.c is from `Marc [polygl0ts]`, who was also the person who told to
patch it. So credit goes to him for figuring out what to do and solving it again
himself on the last day of the CTF :)
