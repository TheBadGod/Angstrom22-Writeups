# Uninspired

We read an input, check that it's only digits and has length 10.
Then we check that it describes itself, as in if there's a 1 in the second
position (index 1), then we have one singular digit '1' in the number.

This was a fun riddle and I solved it in my head in the train, here's the number
I came up with: 6210001000

That resulted in the flag: `actf{ten_digit_numbers_are_very_inspiring}`
